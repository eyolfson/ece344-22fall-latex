  \begin{frame}{The Structure of a Hard Disk Drive (aka HDD)}

  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}{Access Speed Depends on Locality}

    Sectors on same track can be read continuously

    \vspace{2em}

    Switching tracks needs repositioning of the arm

    \hspace{2em} Repositioning the arm is expensive)
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}{You Physically Address a HDD Using Cylinder-Head-Sector (CHS)}

    Data has the following Coordinates (multi-dimensional polar coodinates):

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Platter: which revolving platter (addressed as head) [z Axis]
      \item Track: which track lane on platter (historically cylinder) [$||r||$]
      \item Sector: which sector on track [$\Theta$]
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{2em}

    The historical CHS has an approximate 8 GB limit of addressable space

    \hspace{2em} (512 bytes/sector)×(63 sectors/track)×(255 heads (tracks/cylinder))

    \hspace{2em} ×(1024 cylinders)

    \vspace{2em}

    LBA (Logical Block Addressing) uses one number to address

    any block and is not limited to 8~GB
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}{Shingled Magnet Recording (SMR)}

    The write head only writes in the center of a track, and has unused padding

    \vspace{2em}

    You can't write to this padding without destroying neighboring tracks

    \vspace{2em}

    SMR however, allows you to write over the padding, if you do it sequentially

    \vspace{2em}

    Drive performance may suffer, but it's easier to increase capacity

  \begin{frame}{HDDs Have Latencies Dependent on the Distance Travelled}

    Rotational delay: physically rotate the disk to get to the correct sector

    \hspace{2em} Typically 4-8 ms (average delay is half of a full rotation)

    \vspace{2em}

    Seek time: moving the disk arm to get to the correct track

    \hspace{2em} Typically 0.5-2 ms

    \vspace{2em}

    Transfer time: how long it takes to read bytes from the disk

    \hspace{2em} Typically the maximum transfer speed is 125 MB/s
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}{Calculating Transfer Rate}

    The total time, $\mathsf{T}$, is equal to

    \hspace{2em} rotational delay + seek time + transfer time

    \vspace{2em}

    The transfer rate, $\mathsf{R}$, is equal to

    \hspace{2em} Size of the transfer / $\mathsf{T}$

    \vspace{2em}

    What is the transfer rate of

    \hspace{2em} Large sequential accesses?

    \hspace{2em} Small random accesses?
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}{We Should Use HDDs Sequentially Whenever Possible}
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
                       & HDD 1     & HDD 2      \\
      Rotational speed & 7,200 RPM & 15,000 RPM \\
      Rotational latency (ms) & 4.2 & 2.0 \\
      Average seek (ms) & 9 & 4 \\
      Max transfer & 105 MB/s & 125 MB/s \\
      Platters & 4 & 4 \\
      Interface & SATA & SCSI \\
    \end{tabular}

    \vspace{2em}

    Sequential 100 MB read:

    \hspace{2em} HDD 1, T = 950 ms, R = 105 MB/s

    \hspace{2em} HDD 2, T = 800 ms, R = 125 MB/s

    Random 4 KB read:

    \hspace{2em} HDD 1, T = 13.2 ms, R = 0.31 MB/s

    \hspace{2em} HDD 2, T = 6 ms, R = 0.66 MB/s
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}{Logical Mapping Could Place All Sectors Next to Each Other}

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (0,0) circle (2.4cm);
      \draw (0,0) circle (1.6cm);
      \draw (0,0) circle (0.8cm);
      \foreach \i in {0,1,...,11}
      {
        \draw (\i*360/12: 2cm) node {\i};
      }
      \foreach \i in {12,13,...,19}
      {
        \draw (\i*360/8 - 180: 1.2cm) node {\i};
      }
      \foreach \i in {20,21,...,23}
      {
        \draw (\i*360/4: 0.4cm) node {\i};
      }
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    You may want to offset the sectors in different tracks so the head has
    time to settle

    \hspace{2em} Track skew allows the disk to be efficient with minimal head
    movement
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}{You May Want More Flexibility Than the Default Mapping}
    Pros

    \hspace{2em} Simple to program

    \hspace{2em} Default mapping reduces seek time for sequential access

    \vspace{2em}

    Cons

    \hspace{2em} Filesystem can't inspect or try to optimize the mapping

    \hspace{2em} Trying to reverse the mapping is difficult

    \hspace{4em} Number of sectors per track changes

    \hspace{4em} Disk silently remaps bad sectors
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}{A Cache Can Significantly Speed Up Disk Transfers}

    Disks have some internal memory (WD Red - 64 MB) for caching

    \vspace{2em}

    Implement a read-ahead ``track buffer''

    \hspace{2em} Read the entire contents of the track into memory during the rotational delay

    \vspace{2em}

    Write caching with volatile memory

    \hspace{2em} Write back: claim data is written to disk

    \hspace{4em} Fast, but there's data loss if there's a power failure

    \hspace{4em} Write through: acknowledge after data is physically written
  \end{frame}


  \begin{frame}{We Can Schedule Disk Accesses}

    We want to minimize the time the disk moves without reading or writing data

    \vspace{2em}

    FCFS: schedule requests in the order received

    \hspace{2em} Fair, but it has a high seek and rotation cost

    \vspace{2em}

    SSTF: shortest seek time first

    \hspace{2em} Handle the nearest cylinder/sector next

    \hspace{4em} Pro: reduces arm movement (seek time)

    \hspace{4em} Con: unfair, can starve some requests
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}{Elevator (aka SCAN or C-SCAN) Sweeps Across the Disk}
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (0,0) circle (2.4cm);
      \draw (0,0) circle (1.6cm);
      \draw (0,0) circle (0.8cm);
      \draw (0: 2cm) node {\bf 0};
      \draw (0: 1.2cm) node {\bf 12};
      \draw (0: 0.4cm) node {\bf 20};
      \foreach \i in {1,...,11}
      {
        \draw (\i*360/12: 2cm) node {\i};
      }
      \foreach \i in {13,...,19}
      {
        \draw (\i*360/8 - 180: 1.2cm) node {\i};
      }
      \foreach \i in {21,...,23}
      {
        \draw (\i*360/4: 0.4cm) node {\i};
      }
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    If a request comes in for a track already serviced this sweep, queue it for
    the next
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}{Elevator (or SSTF) Ignores Rotation}
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (0,0) circle (2.4cm);
      \draw (0,0) circle (1.6cm);
      \draw (0,0) circle (0.8cm);
      \foreach \i in {0,1,...,11}
      {
        \draw (\i*360/12: 2cm) node {\i};
      }
      \foreach \i in {12,13,...,19}
      {
        \draw (\i*360/8 - 180: 1.2cm) node {\i};
      }
      \foreach \i in {20,21,...,23}
      {
        \draw (\i*360/4: 0.4cm) node {\i};
      }
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Shortest positioning time first (SPTF) is often the best strategy

    \hspace{2em} The OS and disk need to work together to implement this
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}{Disks Enable Persistence}

    We explored two HDDs today:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Magnetic disks have poor random access (need to be scheduled)
      \item Shortest Positioning Time First (SPTF) is the best scheduling for throughput
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}
