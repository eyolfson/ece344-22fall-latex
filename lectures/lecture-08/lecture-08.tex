  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Multithreading Models}

    Where do we implement threads?

    \hspace{2em} We can either do user or kernel threads

    \vspace{2em}

    User threads are completely in user-space

    \hspace{2em} Kernel doesn't treat your threaded process any differently

    \vspace{2em}

    Kernel threads are implemented in kernel-space

    \hspace{2em} Kernel manages everything for you, and can treat threads specially
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Thread Support Requires a Thread Table}

    Similar to the process table we saw previously

    \hspace{2em} It could be in user-space or kernel-space depending

    \vspace{2em}

    For user threads, there also needs to be a run-time system to determine
    scheduling

    \vspace{2em}

    In both models each process can contain multiple threads
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{We Could Avoid System Calls, or Let a Thread Block Everything}

    For pure user-level threads (again, no kernel support):

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Very fast to create and destroy, no system call, no context switches
      \item One thread blocks, it blocks the entire process (kernel can't distinguish)
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{2em}

    For kernel-level threads:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Slower, creation involves system calls
      \item If one thread blocks, the kernel can schedule another one
    \end{itemize}
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{All Threading Libraries You Use Run in User-mode}

    The thread library maps user threads to kernel threads

    \vspace{2em}

    Many-to-one: threads completely implemented in user-space

    \hspace{2em} the kernel only sees one process

    \vspace{2em}

    One-to-one: one user thread maps directly to one kernel thread

    \hspace{2em} the kernel handles everything

    \vspace{2em}

    Many-to-many: many user-level threads map to many kernel level threads
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Many-to-one is Pure User-space Implementation}

    It's fast (as outlined before) and portable

    \hspace{2em} It doesn't depend on the system, it's just a library

    \vspace{2em}

    Drawbacks are that one thread blocking causes all threads to block

    \hspace{2em} Also we cannot execute threads in parallel

    \hspace{4em} The kernel will only schedule a process to run
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{One-to-one Just Uses the Kernel Thread Implementation}

    There's just a thin wrapper around the system calls to make it easier to use

    \vspace{2em}

    Exploits the full parallelism of your machine

    \hspace{2em} The kernel can schedule multiple threads simultaneously

    \vspace{2em}

    We do however need to use a slower system call interface,
    
    \hspace{2em} and we lose some control

    \vspace{4em}

    Typically this is the actual implementation used, we'll assume this for
    Linux
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Many-to-many is a Hybrid Approach}

    The idea is that there are more user-level threads than kernel-level threads

    \hspace{2em} Cap the number of kernel-level threads to the number we could
    run in parallel

    \vspace{2em}

    We can get the most out of multiple CPUs and reduce the number of system
    calls

    \vspace{2em}

    However, this leads to a complicated thread library

    \hspace{2em} Depending on your mapping luck, you may block other threads
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Threads Complicate the Kernel}

    How should \texttt{fork} work with a process with multiple threads?

    \hspace{2em} Copy all threads to the new process, in whatever state they're
    in?

    \hspace{4em} How would this get out of hand?

    \vspace{2em}

    Linux only copies the thread that called \texttt{fork} into a new process

    \hspace{2em} If it hits \texttt{pthread\_exit} it'll always exit with status
    0

    \hspace{4em} (at least as far as I can tell)

    \vspace{2em}

    There's \texttt{pthread\_atfork} (not covered in this course) to control
    what happens
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Signals are Sent to a Process}

    Which thread should receive a signal? all of them?

    \vspace{2em}

    Linux will just pick one random thread to handle the signal

    \hspace{2em} Makes concurrency hard, any thread could be interrupted
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Instead of Many-to-many, You Can Use a Thread Pool}

    The goal of many-to-many thread mapping is to avoid creation costs

    \vspace{2em}

    A thread pool creates a certain number of threads and a queue of tasks

    \hspace{2em} (maybe as many threads as CPUs in the system)

    \vspace{2em}

    As requests come in, wake them up and give them work to do

    \vspace{2em}

    Reuse them, when there's no work, put them to sleep
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{You'll Implement Many-to-one}

    \begin{tikzpicture}[
      every state/.style={ellipse, minimum width=2.5cm, minimum height=1cm, font=\small},
    ]
      \node [state, initial] (created) {Created};
      \node [state, right=of created] (waiting) {Waiting};
      \node [state, above right=of waiting] (running) {Running};
      \node [state, below right=of waiting] (blocked) {Blocked};
      \node [state, accepting, below right=of running] (terminated) {Terminated};
      \path [->] (created) edge (waiting) node [above, xshift=5em, yshift=1.5em] {\scriptsize \ttfamily thread\_create}
                 (waiting) edge [bend left] (running) node [below, xshift=4.5em, yshift=3em] {\scriptsize \ttfamily thread\_yield}
                 (running) edge [bend left] (waiting)
                 (running) edge (blocked) node [right, yshift=-8em] {\scriptsize \ttfamily thread\_sleep}
                 (blocked) edge (waiting) node [left, xshift=-4em, yshift=2em] {\scriptsize \ttfamily thread\_wakeup}
                 (running) edge (terminated) node [above, xshift=8em, yshift=-3em] {\scriptsize \ttfamily thread\_exit};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Your Scheduler Can Just Be Round Robin}

    Create a queue (list), run the thread at the front, when it yeilds at it to the back

    \vspace{2em}

    You'll have to do the context switch (remember, you'll have to save the registers)

    \vspace{2em}

    These are cooperative threads, so they have to be nice (next is preemptive threads)
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Our Next Complication}

    Let's create a program that spawns 8 threads

    \hspace{2em} Each thread increments the same variable 10,000 times

    \vspace{2em}

    What should the final value of the variable be?

    \hspace{2em} The initial value of the variable is 0

    \vspace{2em}

    Run \texttt{lecture-08/pthread-datarace}

    \hspace{2em} Can you fix it?
  \end{frame}

  \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Both Processes and (Kernel) Threads Enable Parallelization}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Each process can have multiple (kernel) threads
      \item Most implementations use one-to-one user-to-kernel thread mapping
      \item The operating system has to manage what happens during a fork, or signals
      \item We now have synchronization issues
    \end{itemize}
